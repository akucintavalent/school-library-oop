# School Library OOP

Imagine that you are the librarian of OOP University, and you need a tool to record what books are in the library and who borrows them. The app will allow you to:

- Add new students or teachers.
- Add new books.
- Save records of who borrowed a given book and when.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

```
Ruby
```

### Setup

Open terminal and go to the folder you want to store the repo in:

```
# For example
cd Documents
```

Clone the repo and move to the folder with the repo:

```
git clone git@github.com:akucintavalent/school-library-oop.git
cd school-library-oop
```

### Run Program

In order to run any of the ruby files you should run in your terminal:

```
ruby <name-of-the-file>.rb
```

If you want to test one of the files in ruby interpreter, run:

```
irb
```

Then you will be able to import files and test their contents:

```
require './teacher.rb'
t = Teacher.new(33, 'Aniela Szczerbak', false, 'Mathematics')
t.can_use_services?
t.validate_name
require './student.rb'
s = Student.new(12, 'Konrad Kowalski', false, 'Math')
s.play_hooky
s.can_use_services?
# require './corrector.rb'
c = Corrector.new
c.correct_name('Ababa Halamaga')
```

Result of running the above code:

```
ibodi@MacBook-Pro-Bohdan school-library-oop % irb
